# Broken Link Checker (Co-op)
Broken link checker made with Selenium that checks all links within a site. Made in spare time during my co-op.

A good chunk of the code is / inspired from http://www.software-testing-tutorials-automation.com/2015/08/how-to-find-broken-linksimages-from.html and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1201048/allowing-java-to-use-an-untrusted-certificate-for-ssl-https-connection.

Feel free to give constructive criticism / changes.

# Future Changes to Make
- Greatly reduce global vairables (more modular)
- Cleaner code
- More comments / documentation

# v0.1
- Made in Eclipse
- Uses Selenium (remember to reference them in project)
- Runs an IE webdriver (remember to fix path for your machine)

# v0.2
- Runs on IE, Chrome, and Firefox
- Runs on a single page or entire domain (scan at your own risk)
- Saves results in Excel file within a created folder
- Can take screenshots (remove comments) and saves in folder
