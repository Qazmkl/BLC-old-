# Broken Link Checker Co-op
Broken link checker made with Selenium that checks all links within a site. Made in spare time during my co-op.

A good chunk of the code is / inspired from http://www.software-testing-tutorials-automation.com/2015/08/how-to-find-broken-linksimages-from.html and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1201048/allowing-java-to-use-an-untrusted-certificate-for-ssl-https-connection.

Feel free to give constructive criticism / changes.
